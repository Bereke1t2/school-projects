By following these steps, you should be able to set up and test the chat application successfully

1. Set Up the Database:

   • I am using PostgreSQL as the database. If you are using a different database, you will need to modify the package named database in the backend.

   • Important: Make sure to change the username and password in the database configuration to match your database credentials.

2. Create the Database:

   • Open your Database Management System (DBMS).

   • Create a new database called chatapp. 

   • Ensure that the name is spelled correctly, as it must match the name we are connecting to in the application.

3. Run the Backend Server:

   • Navigate to the backend package, then go to the server package.

   • Run the main function in the server package to start the backend server.

4. Run the Main Application:

   • Next, go to the main application file, typically named App.java.

   • Run the main function in App.java.

5. Test User Signup:

   • Sign up with at least two different user accounts to test the application functionality.

6. Test User Login:

   • Log in with the first user account.

   • While keeping the first user's GUI open, run the main function in App.java again.

   • Log in with a second user account.

7. Final Testing:

   • Now you can test the application with both user accounts to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
